Polyphony is an expert-mode modpack for Minecraft 1.18 that is atypical compared to other expert packs:
* **Instead of trying to enhance the difficulty in every facet (such as packs like Enigmatica 2: Expert or FTB Interactions), Polyphony sticks to challenges of logistics and attempts to take it to its limit.** Annoyances like buffed enemies and hunger have been abandoned, and building and manually mining have been even been made easier for the player. However, this does not mean that Polyphony is easy- far from it. You can expect massive processing lines encompassing the mass production of many different materials to complete the pack.
* **Polyphony will provide and maintain Fabric/Quilt-based forks, ports, or rewrites of almost all included mods on top of brand-new mods that aim to provide original content and innovate.** In order to provide the best experience possible, a carefully curated list of mods will be ported to Quilt and Minecraft 1.18 upon their releases with community input for development, fidelity to the original mods' features, integration with other mods, performance, and stability being primary goals. Because of this and the rapid rate at which Fabric/Quilt will be able to update, Polyphony will be able to progress to newer Minecraft versions and adapt to their additions.
* **The progression of the pack is purposefully interconnected.** As opposed to having a hierarchy of mods to determine progression, mods all progress in parallel at similar rates- you will never be at a point where you aren't using the mods that you first set up automation for. This is especially true when considering that many crafts have refinements on their crafting processes that improve the efficiency or output of the process, letting the player optionally redesign or extend their current setup to produce more!
* **Questing has been designed to be as open to the player as possible, serving as a compass for the progression of the pack without telling players exactly what they should do.** Major and minor progression points are provided in a single quest line with no rewards. We believe that for an expert pack, players should rely on their own knowledge.
* **The end-game purposefully avoids the tropes commonly associated with expert pack, and is more akin to a Complete the Monument-style experience.** There is no Avaritia, Draconic Evolution, or Extreme Crafting here. Instead, Polyphony has special, over-the-top challenges that each award special trophies for the player to use as extra content, but are not required to finish the pack.
